## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to arrange elements in a specific order. This repository provides different sorting algorithms implemented in the C programming language. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate file and can be used independently.

The following sorting algorithms are currently implemented:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Cocktail Shaker Sort
- Counting Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

## Algorithms

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate C file within the repository. The source code is well-commented and organized for easy understanding. Additionally, the repository contains sample input files and main files to test the sorting algorithms.

Here is the list of files available in this repository:

- [bubble_sort.c](./bubble_sort.c): Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- [insertion_sort.c](./insertion_sort.c): Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
- [selection_sort.c](./selection_sort.c): Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
- [quick_sort.c](./quick_sort.c): Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm.
- [cocktail_shaker_sort.c](./cocktail_shaker_sort.c): Implementation of the Cocktail Shaker Sort algorithm.
- [counting_sort.c](./counting_sort.c): Implementation of the Counting Sort algorithm.
- [merge_sort.c](./merge_sort.c): Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.
- [heap_sort.c](./heap_sort.c): Implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm.

## Usage

To use any of the sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/sorting_algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm's file:

   ```shell
   $ cd sorting_algorithms
   ```

3. Compile the C file using a C compiler (e.g., gcc):

   ```shell
   $ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic <algorithm_file.c> -o <executable_name>
   ```

4. Execute the compiled file:
   ```shell
   $ ./<executable_name>
   ```

The program will prompt you for the input or use a predefined input array. It will then display the sorted array as output.
